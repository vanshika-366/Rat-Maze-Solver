The provided program is a simulation of a maze-solving problem using a recursive backtracking algorithm. It features a rat that starts at the top-left corner of a randomly generated maze and attempts to find a path to the bottom-right corner, which is designated as the exit. The program is written in C++ and includes several components:

Key Features:
1. Maze Generation:
   - The maze is represented as a 2D grid (`vector<vector<int>>`) where:
     - `1` represents a wall.
     - `0` represents a walkable path.
   - The maze is generated randomly, ensuring the start (0,0) and exit (MAZE_SIZE-1, MAZE_SIZE-1) are always walkable paths.

2. Movement Logic:
   - The rat can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
   - Valid moves are determined by checking boundaries and whether the destination cell is a walkable path.

3. Maze Solving:
   - The rat uses a recursive backtracking algorithm:
     - Marks the current cell as visited by setting it to a wall (`1`).
     - Explores all possible moves from the current cell.
     - Backtracks if it hits a dead-end by removing the cell from the path.

4. Visual Representation:
   - The maze is displayed using:
     - `#` for walls.
     - `.` for paths.
     - `R` for the rat's current position.
     - `E` for the exit position.
   - The final path taken by the rat is printed in a sequence of coordinates.

5. Output:
   - If a path to the exit exists, the program displays the sequence of steps.
   - If no path exists, the program notifies the user.

Functions:
- `void generateRandomMaze()`: Generates a random maze layout.
- `void displayMaze()`: Displays the current state of the maze with the rat's and exit's positions.
- `bool isValidMove()`: Checks if a move is within bounds and leads to a walkable path.
- `bool solveMaze()`: Implements the backtracking algorithm to find a path from start to exit.
- `void displayPath()`: Prints the sequence of steps taken by the rat.

Example Execution:
1. A 10x10 maze is generated randomly.
2. The initial maze is displayed with the rat's starting position and exit.
3. The program attempts to solve the maze:
   - If successful, it prints the path taken by the rat.
   - If no path exists, it informs the user.

This program serves as an excellent example of algorithmic problem-solving, combining recursive logic with maze generation and visualization.
